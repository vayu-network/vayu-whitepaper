# On-Chain Activity & Transparency

Vayu.network is committed to radical transparency. As we are built on a leading Layer-1 blockchain, key activities and network metrics will be verifiable on-chain. This ensures that our community can trust the data and the growth of our ecosystem.

We will provide public dashboards through blockchain analytics platforms like **Dune** or **Subscan** (for the chosen Layer-1 network). These dashboards will offer real-time insights into:

*   **Network Growth:** The total number of active Flux devices on the network.
*   **Data Contribution:** The volume of data points being contributed over time.
*   **Token Distribution:** The flow of `$VAYU` rewards to data contributors.
*   **Marketplace Activity:** The volume of data being purchased from the network.

This on-chain transparency is fundamental to our community-first approach, allowing anyone to independently monitor and verify the health and progress of the Vayu.network.

**Please Note:** In the initial phases, there may be a delay as we progressively migrate all network activity and user metrics on-chain following our launch.
