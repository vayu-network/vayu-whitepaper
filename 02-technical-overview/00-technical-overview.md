# Technical Overview

This section provides a detailed overview of the Vayu.network's technical architecture, from data collection to its application.

Powered by web3 and a leading Layer-1 blockchain, Vayu.network leverages the custom-built Flux device to capture hyper-local indoor air quality data. The device's sensors collect consent-based, anonymized data points for Particulate Matter (PM2.5), Volatile Organic Compounds (TVOC), and equivalent CO2 (eCO2), along with corresponding location data.

This data is then aggregated and visualized on the Vayu Explorer, a public-facing map that allows users to see and understand indoor air quality in their environment. Ultimately, these valuable datasets will be made available through a B2B API, powering applications in real estate, public health, and smart building management, as well as providing crucial data for research and AI models.
