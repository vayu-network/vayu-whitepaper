# Why Blockchain?

**We chose to use blockchain technology for two main reasons: to create a powerful incentive structure and to ensure the highest standards of data verification and traceability.**

## Why We Use Blockchain Technology

### Reason 1: Incentivization

Blockchain enables a transparent, fair, and powerful reward system. Vayu.network's native token, `$VAYU`, is used to directly incentivize users for contributing valuable indoor air quality data via their Flux devices. This decentralized approach aligns the interests of our users with the network's growth, creating a robust and engaged community.

### Reason 2: Data Verification and Traceability

Crucially, the blockchain provides an immutable ledger for data verification. It ensures that every data point contributed to the Vayu.network is authentic, verifiable, and securely recorded. This builds a level of trust and integrity into our dataset that traditional, centralized data collection methods simply cannot match.

## Why We Use a Layer-1 Blockchain

**The short answer:** A Layer-1 blockchain purpose-built for Decentralized Physical Infrastructure Networks (DePINs) and the Economy of Things is ideal for our needs.

**The technical answer:** Selecting a suitable Layer-1 blockchain for Vayu.network was a strategic decision. The chosen network's architecture is designed to support DePINs like ours, which rely on fleets of connected hardware devices.

The infrastructure provides several key advantages for a Hardware DePIN:

*   **Verifiable Device Identity:** The use of Decentralized Identifiers (DIDs) provides a secure, verifiable, and tamper-proof identity for each individual Flux device. This is essential for ensuring the provenance and integrity of the data collected from our hardware fleet.
*   **Scalability and Efficiency:** Peaq offers a highly scalable, low-latency infrastructure capable of supporting millions of real-time data transactions from a global network of devices. Its low transaction costs are critical for making our rewards and data marketplace economically viable.
*   **DePIN-Specific Functions:** Peaq's framework includes functions tailored for DePINs, such as device management and role-based access control, which aligns perfectly with our vision for autonomous data sharing and reward distribution.
*   **Interoperability:** Peaq's focus on interoperability enhances Vayu.network's ability to connect with other decentralized networks and applications, expanding the potential value and utility of our air quality data.

By leveraging peaq's distributed infrastructure, Vayu.network can collect data anonymously, removing personal identifiers while maintaining the integrity and value of the data. This approach respects user privacy while enabling the commercialization of aggregated, anonymized data, ensuring that all parties are protected and informed.
