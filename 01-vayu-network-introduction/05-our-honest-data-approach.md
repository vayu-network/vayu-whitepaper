# Our Honest Data Approach

**Empowering Users Through Privacy, Control, and Transparency**

## Privacy by Design

Vayu.network is built on a foundation of privacy. We ensure user anonymity through robust encryption, data anonymization, and decentralization. Your personal identity is never linked to the data you contribute.

## Your Terms, Your Rewards

You are in complete control. By using the Flux device, you choose to contribute to the network and earn rewards. You can start or stop contributing at any time simply by managing the device's connection to the Vayu.network app.

## Sensor Data Only

Vayu.network is designed to collect only specific environmental data points: Particulate Matter (PM2.5), TVOC, eCO2, and the corresponding anonymous location data. We do not collect any personal data from your phone or any other sensitive information.

## On-Chain Transparency

In the Vayu.network, each data contribution is tied to the unique, anonymous ID of the Flux device. User consent and data transactions are planned to be recorded on the Layer-1 blockchain, ensuring that every contribution is immutable, transparent, and verifiable. This provides a robust and auditable record of the data's origin, while protecting the privacy of the contributor.

## Audited Compliance

Vayu.network is committed to the highest standards of legal and technical compliance. We will undergo regular audits by top-tier institutions to ensure we fully comply with all data privacy standards, offering a secure and transparent data-sharing experience for our users.
